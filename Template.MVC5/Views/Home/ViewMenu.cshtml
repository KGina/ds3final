                    Our Story At Abantwana Winners Day Care & Pre-School.
                    Kwowlwdge is the to a brighter future. Millions of children in Africa dream of education. Ruth Mpoyo is one of the great leaders and founder of Abantwana Winners Day Care & Pre-School.
                    She started the great journey of a milestone in developing early childhood with only one child on a holiday. Two days later 2 more children joined and then she decided to find a secure place to run this centre though the journey was not easy. It was the Grace Of God, she said. We have gone a long way and now we accommodate a considerable number of kids. We welcome you to AWDC.
